## Breaking Changes

Below is a listing of the breaking change for this release, per subject or
integration. Click on one of those to read more about the breaking change
for that specific item.

{% details "Xiaomi Miio" %}

The Xiaomi Miio Fan, Sensor & Light platforms can now be configured via the
UI.

If you currently have them configured using YAML configuration, they will
be automatically imported into the UI on upgrade. After upgrading, you can
safely remove the YAML configuration for these devices.

([@starkillerOG] - [#46866] [#46964] [#47161]) ([xiaomi_miio docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "KNX" %}

The `config_file` YAML option for KNX is deprecated, please remove it from
your YAML configuration if you have it configured.

Float types are no longer valid for sensor / expose sensor type because the
trailing zeros caused troubles when splitting to two integers.

([@farmio] - [#46874] [#48005]) ([knx docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "LIFX Legacy" %}

The LIFX Legacy platform is deprecated and will be removed in Home Assistant
Core 2021.6.0. Use the LIFX integration instead.

([@frenck] - [#47235]) ([lifx_legacy docs])

{% detatils %}

{% details "Secrets" %}

At this moment, we are unsure if this is a breaking change or not, so we
list it, just to be sure.

We are now explicitly only supporting secrets inside your Home Assistant Core
and Lovelace configuration files (and anything included from there). Secrets
are no longer supported in other loaded YAML files.

([@balloob] - [#47034])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HomeKit" %}

The HomeKit `auto_start` configuration option has been deprecated. It dates
from the "old"-days to prevent entities not being available yet when HomeKit
started. However, nowadays, Home Assistant ensures all entities are available
on startup instantly.

Therefore, this option is no longer needed. If you still have it in your
configuration (and have automations for it to start HomeKit); those can be
safely removed as well.

([@frenck] - [#47470]) ([homekit docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Hive" %}

The Hive integration can now be configured via the UI and configuring it via
YAML is now deprecated. If you have an existing YAML configuration,
it will be automatically imported on upgrade. After the upgrade,
the YAML configuration can be safely removed.

([@KJonline] - [#47300]) ([hive docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Wake On LAN" %}

Wake on LAN component now assumes a dummy state if a host is not provided.
Before, the state was only based on the `host` config parameter, which is
listed as optional.

With this change the `host` config is still optional, but if it is not defined,
the state of the switch is simply the last action that was taken. If you're
relying on a Wake on LAN entity in an automation or script, please make sure
that your assumptions about state still hold.

([@ntilley905] - [#47719]) ([wake_on_lan docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Verisure" %}

The Verisure integration largely rewritten and is now configured via the Home
Assistant user interface.

Your existing YAML configuration will be automatically imported when upgrading
Home Assistant Core. After the upgrade completes, you can safely remove the
existing Verisure YAML configuration.

If after upgrade your Verisure alarm system doesn't appear, please check your
[integrations dashboard](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/).
In rare cases (with accounts that have access to multiple Verisure alarm
systems), it might be needed to select the specific Verisure alarm system to
migrate.

This also means the YAML configuration for the Verisure integration is now
deprecated and will be removed in Home Assistant Core 2021.6.0.

The services provided by the Verisure integration have changed to match the
standard way of how Home Assistant handles services. The following services
are affected by this change:

- {% my developer_call_service service="verisure.capture_smartcam" %}
- {% my developer_call_service service="verisure.disable_autolock" %}
- {% my developer_call_service service="verisure.enable_autolock" %}

Previously these services required a `device_serial` parameter, they have now
changed to accept a regular Home Assistant entity, device or area as a target.
For example:

```yaml
- service: verisure.enable_autolock
  target:
     entity_id: lock.my_verisure_lock
```

If you used any of these services in your automations or scripts, please make
sure you update them after updating to Home Assistant Core 2021.4.0.

([@frenck] - [#47880] [#47905]) ([verisure docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Prometheus" %}

Before this change, all sensors in an unknown state when the Prometheus exporter
starts (i.e.: when Home Assistant starts) were being setup and metrics were
exported with a default value of `0`. Now, they will not be exported anymore
(unless they become available again) - they can be found by searching for
metrics where `entity_available` is `0` (will reveal both entities that are
in unknown or unavailable state).

You should update any automations, scripts or 3rd party data consumers that
depend on the old prometheus export with default value `0`.

([@inetAnt] - [#47840]) ([prometheus docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "August" %}

August has fully transitioned to configuration via UI. YAML configuration is
no longer supported. Existing YAML configuration has already been imported
automatically in the previous releases and can now safely be removed from your
configuration files.

([@bdraco] - [#47615]) ([august docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Workday" %}

The Workday integration used to operate on the timezone configured on the
system, instead of the timezone configured in Home Assistant. This can become
problematic, for example, if your system runs on UTC, but you are 11 hours
ahead of that.

This behavior has been correct and the workday sensors now rely on the timezone
configured in Home Assistant. You might need to adjust to this, if you have
automations, scripts or templates that previously manually corrected this.

([@schiermi] - [#47927]) ([workday docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Ubiquiti UniFi Video" %}

The datetime returned in the `last_recording_start_time` state attribute of the
uvc camera entity was changed from local time to be UTC time. All times in state
attributes must be UTC time. You should update any automations or scripts that
depends on this state attribute.

([@sycx2] - [#41438]) ([uvc docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave JS" %}

Zwave JS climate devices that report their temperature in Fahrenheit will now
report in tenth precision instead of whole precision, when the device supports
it.

Previously, when those devices reported a temperature of, for example, 67.6F it
would be rounded and reported in whole precision as 68F. Those devices will now
report the temperature with tenth precision, thus 67.6F.

This means that if you currently have automation that depends on the temperature
reported by these devices you may have to adjust their functionality to work
properly with how the temperature is now being reported.

([@chilicheech] - [#48133]) ([zwave_js docs])\

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Templates" %}

Previously, during template rendering, undefined variables are replaced with an
empty string. As an example the template `{{undefined_variable}}` will render as
the empty string. This is error prone as it means misspelled or non existent
variables are silently accepted by the template engine.

Starting this release, there will be a warning message in the log when a
variable is undefined, but it is still rendered as the empty string. So, besides
the warning, right now, nothing changes.

Starting with Home Assistant 2021.10, undefined variables will be treated as an
error and template rendering will fail.

To allow rendering of templates where it is expected that a variably may not
be defined without logging a warning or failing to render, use the `default`
filter: `{{undefined_variable | default}}`.

([@emontnemery] - [#48140])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ZeroConf" %}

Zeroconf will now only listen on the default interface by default.

If you need to broadcast mDNS responses to all interfaces or retain the
previous behavior, set [default_interface](/integrations/zeroconf/#default_interface)
to `false`.

With multiple interfaces, mDNS traffic processing happened numerous times since
the duplicate packets appeared on each interface. This behavior was not
desirable for most cases which necessitated a change in the default.

The Home Assistant Operating System has multiple interfaces and was affected.

([@bdraco] - [#48302]) ([zeroconf docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Google Cast" %}

The YAML configuration for the Google Cast integration has been deprecated and
will be fully removed in  Home Assistant Core 2021.6.0.

If you have existing YAML configuration for the Google Cast integration, please
remove it from your configuration.

([@emontnemery] - [#47269]) ([cast docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Neato" %}

Vacuum attributes `clean start`, `clean stop` and camera
attribute `generated_at` are now in a timestamp format.

New format is "2021-03-20T10:35:47Z". This allow automation to use their
value based on `as_timestamp()`.

If you relies on these attributes in your automation or script, you might need
to adjust them to match this change.

([@chemelli74] - [#48150]) ([neato docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

The [fan entity model](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity/fan/)
has been changed. This impacts the way the MQTT Fan supports speeds and the
following configuration options are deprecated and will be removed in
Home Assistant Core 2021.7.0:

- `speed_command_topic`
- `speed_state_topic`
- `state_value_template`
- `speed_list`

([@jbouwh] - [#47944]) ([mqtt docs])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Core / Custom integrations" %}

Block detectable I/O in the event loop

We added a warning when this happens last April and gave developers
a year to fix the instability. We now prevent the instability by
raising RuntimeError when code attempts to do known I/O in the
event loop instead of the executor.

We now provide a suggestion on how to fix the code that is causing
the issue.

([@bdraco] - [#48387])

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ModBus" %}

You can now use the new style configuration when configuring the modbus
integration. The existing configuration style is kept, allowing you to change
gradually.

Remark the existing configuration style will be removed in a couple of releases.

Example of an existing configuration:

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: "hub1"
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502

sensor:
  platform: modbus
  registers:
    - name: "Sensor1"
      hub: "hub1"
      unit_of_measurement: "°C"
      slave: 1
      register: 100
```

Same configuration in new style:

```yaml
modbus:
  - name: "hub1"
    type: tcp
    host: IP_ADDRESS
    port: 502
    sensors:
      - name: "Sensor1"
        slave: 1
        address: 100
```

([@janiversen] - [#46591]) ([modbus docs])

{% enddetails %}
